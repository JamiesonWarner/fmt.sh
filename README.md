Universal text formatter for the command line. fmt is a working title, but it's already taken. lazyformat? lzyfmt? zormat? lazmat? fm2? 

```bash

$ cat json | fmt
    { 
        "this": "is"
        "neat" : []
    }

$ px aux | grep nobody | fmt

       really cool
       tables line up
       nicely neat

```
